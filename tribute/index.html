				<h2><i class="fa fa-sun-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Solar City</h2>

				<p>On June 17, 2014, Musk committed to building in Buffalo, New York, a SolarCity advanced production facility that would triple the size of

				<h2><i class="fa fa-circle-o-notch" aria-hidden="true"></i> Hyper Loop</h2>
				<p>On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized

					high-speed travel with relatively low power, with certain other features like air-bearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag. The alpha
